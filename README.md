# neuroevolution

Simulation of the evolutionary algorithm using the example of teaching cars not to leave the track.
In every generation, the behavior of the car that has driven farther than the rest is preserved.
On the basis of this specimen, new specimens are created with some degree of randomness, and so on until at least one learns to recognize the edge of the track.
